## Requirements <a name = "requirements"></a>

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

<br />

## Installation <a name = "install"></a>

- Install by <b>Composer:</b>
```shell
composer create-project mudrock/mudrock my-project
```

<br />

- Run by <b>Docker:</b>
```shell
cd my-project
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

<br />

- Now open your browser and access the URL:
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

<br />

## Routes<a name = "routes"></a>

<br />

### Allowed request types:<a name = "allowed_requests"></a>

- GET
- POST

<br />

### How to define routes:<a name = "how_to_define_routes"></a>

- All routes must be defined in the file:
```html
app/config/routes.php
```

<br />

- You can declare the route using a method of some Controller:
```php
$this->get('/MyRoute', 'MyController@MyFunction'); 
```

<br />

- Or simply define a callback:
```php
$this->get('/MyRoute', function(){
    return "This is my callback when accessing this route";
}); 
```

<br />

## Translations:<a name = "translations"></a>

<div align="center" style="background-color: #ccc; color: black; border-radius: 10px">With the translations feature it is possible to have multiple languages in your project. All this simply quickly!</div>

<br>

- First, you need to create a folder named after the desired language. For example, we will use the language "Portuguese". So, we create the folder as desired:
```php
app/languages/portuguese/
```

<br>

- Now we need to create the files with the translations. We recommend creating a file for each Controller:
```php
app/languages/portuguese/MyController.php
```

<br>

- In the created file ("MyController.php"), we will have a structure similar to this:
```php
<?php

return [
    'my_phrase' => 'My sentence translated to the desired language'
];
```

<br>

- Now we need to load this translation file into the "<b>construct</b>" method of the Controller file:
```php
<?php
namespace app\controllers;
use system\core\Controller;

class Welcome extends Controller {

    public function __construct() {
        $this->load_language('MyController');
    }

}
?>
```

<br>

- Once that's done, we can now use our translation in the Controller and also in the View we are using:
```php
$this->lang('my_phrase');
```
